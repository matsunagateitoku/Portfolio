Running a Python script directly on a webpage isn't something that can be done using just HTML, CSS, or client-side technologies like JavaScript. Web browsers do not natively support running Python code on the client side for security and performance reasons. However, you can run Python code on a server, which can interact with your webpage.

To run a Python script on your webpage, you'll need to use a **web framework** to serve Python code on the server and send the results to the client (your webpage). Common frameworks include **Flask**, **Django**, or **FastAPI**. Here's a basic guide to help you get started with running Python on a webpage using Flask.

### Steps to run a Python script on a webpage:

#### 1. **Set up Flask (Python web framework)**

First, you need to install Flask. Open a terminal and install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

#### 2. **Create a basic Flask app**

Create a new directory for your project and inside that directory, create a Python file, such as `app.py`. This file will handle the server-side logic.

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # Here, you can call your Python functions and return data to the webpage
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### 3. **Create the HTML template (index.html)**

Now, inside your project directory, create a folder called `templates`. Inside this folder, create an `index.html` file that will display your webpage.

```html
<!-- templates/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Haiku Database</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Haiku Database</h1>
    <p>This is a webpage where Python runs on the server side!</p>

    <!-- Example of dynamically generated Python content -->
    <p>Current date and time: {{ current_time }}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 4. **Modify your Python script to pass data to the template**

You can modify your Python script (`app.py`) to send data to your HTML template. For example, you can pass the current date and time:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    return render_template('index.html', current_time=current_time)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### 5. **Run the Flask app**

Go back to your terminal and run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, Flask will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open that URL in your browser, and you should see the content generated by your Python script.

#### 6. **Deploy the Flask app (optional)**

If you want your webpage to be accessible over the internet, youâ€™ll need to deploy your Flask app to a web hosting service. You can use services like:

- **Heroku**: A cloud platform that makes it easy to deploy Python applications.
- **AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean**: More advanced cloud hosting platforms.

To deploy on **Heroku**, for example, you can follow these steps:

- Install the Heroku CLI: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
- Initialize a git repository in your project folder (if not already done).
- Create a `requirements.txt` file listing Flask as a dependency:

  ```bash
  flask==2.2.2
  ```

- Create a `Procfile` to tell Heroku how to run your app:

  ```txt
  web: python app.py
  ```

- Run the following commands in your terminal:

  ```bash
  git init
  heroku create
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git push heroku master
  ```

Heroku will host your Python app, and you will get a URL where you can access it.

### Key Notes:
- Python code runs on the server side, not in the browser.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used for client-side functionality.
- Flask is a simple and lightweight Python web framework that allows you to integrate Python code with web pages.

If you want to interact with Python more directly (e.g., call functions, run scripts on button clicks), you can use **AJAX** (with JavaScript) to send requests to the server, which will then execute Python code and return results back to the client.
